    "\n",
    "**Components of ARIMA:**\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoRegression (AR): ARIMA models incorporate the autoregressive component, which predicts future values in the time series based on past values. It assumes that the future values of the series depend linearly on its own past values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrated (I): The integrated component refers to differencing the time series data to make it stationary. Stationarity is essential for ARIMA models as they work best with stationary data. Differencing involves subtracting the previous observation from the current observation to remove trends or seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving Average (MA): The moving average component accounts for the relationship between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations. It captures the short-term fluctuations or noise in the data.\n",

    "**Steps to Use ARIMA for Forecasting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Preparation: Preprocess the time series data, including handling missing values, resampling, and ensuring stationarity through differencing.\n",

    "Model Identification: Identify the appropriate order of ARIMA parameters (p, d, q). This involves analyzing the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plots to determine the values of p and q. The parameter d is determined by the number of differences required to make the series stationary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Estimation: Estimate the parameters of the ARIMA model using maximum likelihood estimation or other optimization techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Validation: Validate the ARIMA model by assessing its goodness of fit using statistical measures such as AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) or BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion), and by examining residual diagnostics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forecasting: Once the ARIMA model is validated, use it to forecast future values of the time series. Forecasting can be done recursively by iteratively predicting future values based on past observations.\n",

    "\n",
    "ARIMA models are flexible and can capture a wide range of time series patterns, including trends, seasonality, and irregular fluctuations.\n",
